# IexTest

Elixit comes with a wonderful doctest extension to its testing
framework. This reads the documentation for the functions in your code
and extracts from them and `iex` sessions. It then runs the code in
these sessions and verifies that the output is the same as the output
shown in the example.

Unfortunately, this code is hardwired into the testing framework. It
also only works on `@doc` comments in compiled Elixir files.

I had a need to do something a little different. In the book
_Programming Elixir_, I have lots of sample iex sessions. These are
used to demonstrate various language features. Although the book was
written in Markdown, the iex sessions are actually formatted using a
preprocessor, and it looks for something like this:

~~~
Elixir has some operators that work specifically on lists:

<iex>
iex>  [ 1, 2, 3 ] ++ [ 4, 5, 6 ]      # concatenation
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
iex> [1, 2, 3, 4] -- [2, 4]           # difference
[1,3]
iex> 1 in [1,2,3,4]                   # membership
true
iex> "wombat" in [1,2,3,4]
false
</iex>

#### Keyword Lists {#sec-keyword-list}

Because we often need simple lists of key/value pairs, Elixir gives us
a short-circuit syntax. If you write
~~~

So I wrote a little tool that does the same thing doctest does, but
that works on the book's source files.

## Running The Tool

~~~
$ bin/iex_test path_to_file...
~~~

## Contents of the File

Right now, it only looks for iex sessions between `<iex>` and `</iex>`
tags.

The opening `<iex>` tag can take options:

`in="dir"`

: specify a directory (relative to pwd) in which to run the code. This
  allows you to open files, compile, and so on.
  
`test="no"`

: Do not run iex_test on this example.
